 ## Setup
 
'Medical_Assistant.java' file should be built at first using any Java supported IDE. During building if some libraries are missing then 
'MEDICAL ASSISTANT\APACHE LANG3 LIBRARY\commons-lang3-3.6\commons-lang3-3.6.jar' file should be imported. XAMPP server should be setup locally.Then using 'phpMyAdmin' a 
database named 'medical_assistant' should be created from there the 'REQUIRED SQL TABLE\medical_assistant (1).sql' file should be imported. Now the project is ready to run.
